== Mort - the Mortgage Calculator

Mort is a simple monthly housing payment calculator built on top of
Sinatra [http://sinatrarb.com/]. It takes an interest rate, loan term,
purchase price, down payment, property tax rate and optional HOA fees
and uses them to calculate the monthly mortgage payment, monthly property
tax and total monthly payment.

It's really pretty stupid.

But it gave me a chance to fart around with Sinatra.
